# SFFDB

This is the source code to the Django app that ran on sffdb.com from 2012-2016.

The site was basically an IMDB for science fiction and fantasy television and
movies.

There's already an IMDB for that. It's called IMDB.

In any case, I had fun detailing the people who played bit parts in Star Trek
reruns as I watched them even there was no need for the site to exist (and it
received effectively zero traffic).

The source code is provided here under the MIT license in case anyone would
find it useful. I do not expect anyone to find it useful, especially since it
uses function-based views and most Django people I run into prefer class-based
views.
